This is the assembled memory of Rowena Harris, put together by her long-time friend as a thank you for being a lovely person.

It's been created using a static [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site running [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate blog posts. The search is powered using [Jekyll Tipue Search](https://github.com/jekylltools/jekyll-tipue-search) (which is pretty great). A front-end CMS for the site is provided by [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) which makes GitHub altogether less scary

Source code for the site is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/electronicdreamplant/memorybox/tree/gh-pages)
